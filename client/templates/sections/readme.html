    <p>songhorns.org is built on <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor</a>, which is a web framework that incorporates a lot of really convenient things, like MongoDB, reactivity with Blaze, and templating with Spacebars (the same idea as Handlebars), and most importantly, a great packaging system. Basically, all of our content is divided into templates, with each template representing a different piece of the website. For example, on the main page, we have a header template, a welcome template (for the title and background image), an about template, a members template, a videos template, and a footer template. The advantage is that it makes the code a lot easier to read and maintain; the disadvantage is that there's a ton of different files where a few would suffice.</p>

    <p>We use databases, albeit somewhat trivially. Spacebars works really well with Mongo -- a lot of the inbuilt commands play nice with Mongo's database access calls -- so right now, our members and repertoire are stored in Mongo databases (with a video database coming soon). Eventually, we're going to move all of our content -- stuff like the title/slogan, image sources, about text, and even site layout -- to a database, and then write a front-end into the database to simulate a CMS to make updating the website really easy -- i.e., no knowledge of web programming required.</p>

    <p>The UI is courtesy of <a href="http://materializecss.com">Materialize.css</a>, which is a fantastic framework that implements Google's Material Design spec. Despite its name, it provides a lot of JavaScript things in addition to the suite of CSS rules. It's like Bootstrap, just with a different flavor, which means it's very much drag-and-drop. Materialize also has excellent support for Meteor, and even supports a Meteor package. The member cards section is organized by masonry.js, which is what places the cards up against each other rather than forcing them into a grid.</p>

    <p>songhorns.org is hosted on a <a href="http://digitalocean.com">DigitalOcean</a> machine. DigitalOcean is really cheaply priced and has excellent support and documentation.
